# Welcome to the Project! 

As an amateur to GitHub - I am still attempting to organize my files and upload them here.
In the meantime, please be patient with me as I work to create an easy to digest project overview. Thank you! 
Project components will be placed under here as seperate "branches" as they are uploaded. Unforutnately, because I 
had worked on many of my favorite projects on work computers provided me over the terms of my club participation or 
internship, I am doing my best to "fill in the gaps" and gather my files from what I have left on my personal computer. Everything should be here by the end of Feburary. Thank you all so much for your patience, and it's been wonderful having you here! :) 

I've got a few project uploads planned over the next month: 

- Model Rocket
- MATLAB Fluid Simulation
- CNC Router Program Files
