#This Arduino code is designed to trigger a sound playback when a model rocket reaches its apogee,
the highest point in its flight trajectory. The code continuously reads altitude data from an altitude
sensor connected to an analog pin. Once the altitude exceeds a predefined threshold value (`apogeeThreshold`), 
indicating that the rocket has reached apogee, it triggers the playback of a sound through a buzzer connected 
to a specified pin (`buzzerPin`). In this case, the sound played is "YIPEE!". This code provides a 
simple mechanism to celebrate the rocket reaching its peak altitude during flight. :>


// Define constants
const int altimeterPin = A0; // Analog pin for reading altitude sensor
const int buzzerPin = 9;     // Pin for buzzer
const int apogeeThreshold = 500; // Adjust this value based on your altitude sensor and expected altitude

// Variable to store altitude
int altitude;

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // Initialize buzzer pin
  pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read altitude from altimeter
  altitude = analogRead(altimeterPin);
  
  // Check if altitude is above apogee threshold
  if (altitude >= apogeeThreshold) {
    // Play sound when apogee is detected
    playSound();
  }
  
  // Print altitude for debugging
  Serial.print("Altitude: ");
  Serial.println(altitude);
  
  // Delay to control loop frequency
  delay(1000); // Adjust as needed
}

void playSound() {
  // Play sound with buzzer
  tone(buzzerPin, 1000); // Adjust frequency as needed
  delay(1000); // Adjust duration as needed
  noTone(buzzerPin);
}
