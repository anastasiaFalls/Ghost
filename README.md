# What is this? 

As an amateur to GitHub - I am still attempting to organize my files and upload them here.
In the meantime, please be patient with me as I work to create an easy to digest project overview. Thank you! 
Project components will be placed under the main (and only) branch. Unforutnately, because I 
had worked on many of my favorite projects on work computers provided me over the terms of my club participation or 
internship, I am doing my best to "fill in the gaps" and gather my files from what I have left on my personal computer. Thank you all so much for your patience, and it's been wonderful having you here! :)

# What is this specific project? 


This is my first model rocket. It is an L2 J-motor rocket that I constructed, launched, programmed, and engineered over the span of a little over a year as part of an internship I had at the Hollywood Coast Gaurd, in Hollywood, California. This overview will provide a simplified overview of the project, engineering process, and as much code as I can retrieve for the various components of the flight computer here.

# What will this repository show me? 

Electronic components, schematics, CAD model(s), and other information I deem useful to presenting the project (timelines, sketches, etc.)
