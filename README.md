# What is this? 

As an amateur to GitHub - I am still attempting to organize my files and upload them here.
In the meantime, please be patient with me as I work to create an easy to digest project overview. Thank you! 
Project components will be placed under the main (and only) branch. Unforutnately, because I 
had worked on many of my favorite projects on work computers provided me over the terms of my club participation or 
internship, I am doing my best to "fill in the gaps" and gather my files from what I have left on my personal computer. Thank you all so much for your patience, and it's been wonderful having you here! :)

# What is this specific project? 

This is my first model rocket. It is an L2 J-motor rocket I made over the span of a year's long internship at the California Coast Gaurd in Long Beach/Hollywood. I briefly worked with a team during the initial design process, but mostly assumed the project independently. I created the code, PCB Boards, Body, and Final Assembly. 


# What will this repository show me? 

Whatever I can recover from my personal computer. Some code, schematics, CAD, etc. The project was primarily worked over another computer provided to me over the term of my internship. (This was highly crucial, because the various programs I used, for CAD, for instance, Cadence Allegro, etc, are VERY eexpensive for personal use!) This means that this project may be in fragments, but hopefully can relay some interesting information about the project.
