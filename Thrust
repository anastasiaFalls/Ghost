//PERSONAL NOTE;

The Cesaroni 38mm motor was definitely a unique choice. 
Instead of purchasing a metal aft closure (like all the other reload motor sizes), a throw-away aft closure is neeeded.

What this means is that each time the motor was assembled, I used the aft closure included in the 38mm propellant kit,
then fly the motor, and throw away the leftover propellant gunk and aft closure.
